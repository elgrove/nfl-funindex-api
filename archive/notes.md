- Celery to schedule scraping
- Front end in vanilla html, bootstrap, js
    - Add link to last week
    - Add sortable table
    - A bit more styling
    - Dockerise - this will be fun
    - Then call the vanilla front end finished?
- Better to do server side templating though? in Django or Flask?

If I were redesign the current app:
- Create scraper and resulting model inside Django
-
