# NFL Fun Index

A website that uses statistics to rank last week's NFL games by how fun they are to watch, without giving away the score.

## Description

I like NFL but don't live in the US or have much exposure to the US sports media, so I find it easy to avoid finding out the scores. This website analyses data from the games and provides a 'fun index' score for the previous week's games, so I can find out which were the best and acquire video of them to watch during the week.
